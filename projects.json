As a full-stack developer, I created a monitoring tool designed for my team and other colleagues. Throughout this project, I gained proficiency in Go, Vue.js, Docker, gRPC, Apache Kafka, and Kubernetes. I also honed my skills in Git and Bash. Specifically for Vue.js, I served as a scout, introducing and presenting the technology to my peers. I am very happy with this internship and am grateful for my colleagues who were very knowledgeable and generous.",
